# Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.

# PostGIS is required — migration 0001 does `CREATE EXTENSION postgis` and
# every geo query depends on it. Cloud SQL supports the extension on
# PostgreSQL 15; it still has to be created inside the database, which the
# migrator does on first run.
#
# Private IP only: the instance has no public address and is reachable
# solely over the VPC peering established in network.tf.
