# Atlas

**Atlas is a developer platform for building location-aware, real-time, transactional apps.** Drop it into a mobility project and you get auth, geospatial queries, payments, and an event bus without configuring any of it yourself.

The platform exposes four namespaces that mirror four backend services:

* `atlas.auth` for JWT identity with optional geospatial claims
* `atlas.geo` for PostGIS-backed nearby search, route scoring, and geofencing
* `atlas.payments` for wallets, idempotent transactions, and settlement
* `atlas.events` for a protobuf-encoded Kafka event bus

Atlas is multi-tenant: many applications share one deployment and none of
them can see another's users, locations, or money.

A developer configures everything by dropping an `atlas.toml` in their project root, runs `atlas deploy`, and starts calling the SDK in their language of choice.

## Why this project exists

Most consumer mobility apps re-solve the same hard problems in isolation: identity, geospatial search, trust scoring, real-time messaging, and payments. Atlas is a study in what those problems look like when you build them once, as services, and ship them as a plug-and-play platform.

It is intentionally polyglot and event-driven. The systems work is the point.

## Status

In active development. The repository currently contains:

* A working Rust CLI (`atlas`) with config parsing, validation, deploy, status, logs, and key management
* Three backend services: **auth** (Kotlin), **geo** (Rust), **payments** (Kotlin)
* An **API gateway** (Rust/Axum) that terminates public HTTP, validates JWTs, and fans out to all three over gRPC
* Three **Kafka consumers**: location (retention), safety (geofence alerts), fare (settlement)
* A **control plane** (Rust/Axum) backing the CLI: accounts, project provisioning, API keys, live status, and an audit trail
* gRPC contracts for every internal service (`proto/`)
* Kafka event schemas (`proto/events.proto`)
* Per-schema SQL migrations including PostGIS extensions
* Local development environment via `docker-compose`
* CI on GitHub Actions: fmt + clippy + tests for Rust, Gradle build for Kotlin, and a job that applies every migration against a real PostGIS instance
* A **migration runner** (`atlas-migrate`) with recorded history, so schema changes can be applied to a running database
* **Kubernetes manifests** for the whole platform — Deployments, HPAs, PDBs, NetworkPolicies, Ingress — validated in CI against real API schemas
* **Container images** for all nine workloads, built and pushed to GHCR on every push
* **Terraform** for GCP: VPC, GKE with Dataplane V2, private Cloud SQL with PostGIS, Secret Manager, Workload Identity
* A **TypeScript SDK** (`sdks/typescript`) with zero runtime dependencies, covering the whole gateway surface

* **Multi-tenancy** across the whole data plane: project-scoped users,
  locations, geofences, wallets and transactions, with the boundary
  enforced in SQL where it can be

Still to come: the Dart and Rust SDKs.

### Database migrations

Migrations used to be mounted into the Postgres container at
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. That directory runs **only on a database's
first boot**, which meant a new migration was silently skipped by anyone
who already had a volume, nothing recorded what had been applied, and there
was no way at all to change the schema of a running database.

`tools/migrator` replaces it. It records applied versions in
`_sqlx_migrations`, applies only what is pending, wraps each migration in a
transaction, and verifies checksums so an applied file cannot be edited out
from under a deployed environment.

```bash
docker compose up -d          # migrator runs first; services wait for it
docker compose run --rm migrator status   # applied vs pending
```

Services never migrate on startup — with several replicas booting at once
that is a race, and a failed migration would crash-loop every pod instead
of failing one Job. In Kubernetes it is a `Job`, and each service blocks on
an init container running `atlas-migrate status --check`.

**If you have a volume from before this landed**, its schema came from the
old initdb path and has no recorded history. Adopt it once:

```bash
docker compose run --rm migrator baseline --through 40 \
    --i-understand-this-skips-sql
```

`--through` has no default on purpose: the tool cannot verify which
migrations a legacy database actually received, and guessing would silently
skip real schema changes. Or just start clean with `docker compose down -v`.

### Building from source

Two system packages are required before `cargo build` will work, because
every Rust service runs `tonic-build` in its `build.rs`:

```bash
apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler cmake   # protoc for codegen, cmake for librdkafka
```

The Kotlin build needs only a JDK 21 — `protobuf-gradle-plugin` resolves
`protoc` from Maven rather than the system.

## Technical scope

| Area | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend services | Rust (Axum, Tonic) and Kotlin (Ktor) |
| Developer CLI | Rust (clap, reqwest, tokio) |
| Inter-service RPC | gRPC with shared `.proto` contracts |
| Event bus | Apache Kafka with protobuf-encoded payloads |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 with PostGIS (per-service schemas, single instance) |
| SDKs | TypeScript (shipped); Dart and Rust planned |
| Infrastructure | Terraform, Kubernetes on GKE, Docker Compose for local dev |
| Observability | Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

## Developer surface

A new project starts with a single config file:

```toml
[project]
name        = "my-mobility-app"
api_key     = "atl_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
environment = "production"
region      = "us-central1"

[services]
auth     = true
geo      = true
payments = true
events   = true
```

Then the CLI takes over:

```bash
atlas validate    # parse and validate atlas.toml
atlas deploy      # provision services with the Atlas control plane
atlas status      # show current service health
atlas logs auth   # tail logs for a given service
atlas keys list   # manage API keys
```

The CLI still defaults to an in-memory mock transport, so it works with no
backend at all. Pass `--live` to talk to a real control plane.

### Going live

The control plane runs on 8081, which is the CLI's default base URL. Start
it, then mint the account key that `atlas.toml` needs — this is the one
bootstrap step, because every other route requires a key and `atlas deploy`
cannot create the account that would hold one:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres control-plane

curl -sX POST http://localhost:8081/v1/accounts \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com"}'
# => {"account_id":"...","api_key":"atl_dev_...","prefix":"atl_dev_...", ...}
```

Paste that `api_key` into `atlas.toml` as `project.api_key` — it is shown
once and is not recoverable — then:

```bash
atlas deploy --live      # creates the project; idempotent on re-run
atlas status --live      # live gRPC health probes + real gateway metrics
atlas keys create ci --expiry 90d --live
atlas logs --live        # the project's audit trail
```

`POST /v1/accounts` is the only unauthenticated write in the platform. It
is rate limited (3/min per client address by default) but still has no
email verification, so anyone who can reach it can create accounts.

### What `atlas status` actually measures

`healthy` is a live probe on every call — a gRPC `Health/Check` against
auth, geo, and payments, and a TCP connect to Kafka for `events`. Nothing
is cached, so a service that dies is `DOWN` on the next invocation.

The three numeric columns are parsed from the gateway's Prometheus
endpoint, which is the only place per-request data exists. Two honest
caveats: `requests_24h` is really "since the gateway process started"
(a true 24-hour window needs a time-series database to difference the
counter, which is Prometheus' job, not this service's), and `events` has
no gateway routes so its counters are always zero — only its health means
anything.

## HTTP API

The gateway is the only service exposed publicly. Everything behind it
speaks gRPC on a private network.

| Method | Path | Key | Token | Backend RPC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/v1/auth/register` | required | — | `auth.Register` |
| POST | `/v1/auth/login` | required | — | `auth.Authenticate` |
| POST | `/v1/auth/logout` | required | Bearer | `auth.RevokeToken` |
| GET | `/v1/auth/me` | required | Bearer | `auth.ValidateToken` |
| POST | `/v1/auth/password-reset` | required | — | `auth.RequestPasswordReset` |
| POST | `/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm` | required | — | `auth.ResetPassword` |
| POST | `/v1/auth/email/verify` | required | — | `auth.RequestEmailVerification` |
| POST | `/v1/auth/email/verify/confirm` | required | — | `auth.VerifyEmail` |
| POST | `/v1/geo/locations` | required | Bearer | `geo.UpdateLocation` |
| GET | `/v1/geo/nearby` | required | Bearer | `geo.GetNearby` |
| POST | `/v1/geo/routes/score` | required | Bearer | `geo.ScoreRoute` |
| POST | `/v1/geo/geofences` | required | Bearer | `geo.CreateGeofence` |
| GET | `/v1/geo/geofences` | required | Bearer | `geo.ListGeofences` |
| DELETE | `/v1/geo/geofences/:id` | required | Bearer | `geo.DeleteGeofence` |
| POST | `/v1/geo/safety/votes` | required | Bearer | `geo.CastSafetyVote` |
| POST | `/v1/geo/geofences/check` | required | Bearer | `geo.TriggerGeofenceCheck` |
| POST | `/v1/payments/deposits` | required | Bearer | `payments.Deposit` |
| GET | `/v1/payments/wallet` | required | Bearer | `payments.GetWalletBalance` |
| POST | `/v1/payments/transactions` | required | Bearer | `payments.InitiateTransaction` |
| GET | `/healthz`, `/readyz` | — | — | — |

The full contract is in [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml) — 21
operations with schemas, error codes, and the reasoning behind the odd
ones (why reset requests always answer 202, why deleting someone else's
geofence is a 404). `scripts/check-openapi-routes.py` compares it against
the axum routers in CI, in both directions, so it cannot quietly drift:
an operation the gateway serves but the spec omits fails, and so does one
the spec invents.

Errors use one envelope, with a stable `code` for SDKs to branch on:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "invalid_argument", "message": "radius_m must be > 0" } }
```

### Two credentials

Every `/v1` request carries two independent identities, and conflating
them is the mistake worth avoiding:

| Header | Answers | Comes from | Lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Atlas-Key: atl_live_…` | which application is calling | `atlas keys create` | your server, in an env var |
| `Authorization: Bearer …` | which of your users is calling | `POST /v1/auth/login` | per user, per session |

Neither substitutes for the other. Both are required even on register and
login, because creating a user means creating them in a project.

**The project key is a server-side secret.** Anyone holding it can act on
your whole project, so it must not ship in a browser bundle or a mobile
app.

Health probes take neither: a liveness check that 401s would have
Kubernetes restart every pod.

### The identity rules

**No request body on this API has a `user_id` or a `project_id` field.**
Both are injected by the gateway — `user_id` from the validated token,
`project_id` from the resolved key — so a caller can name neither. It can
only present credentials that name them. The backends trust that
guarantee, which is why the gateway must be the only route in, and they
reject an absent `project_id` rather than defaulting: on the trusted side
of the boundary a missing value is a bug, and defaulting would turn that
bug into silent cross-tenant access.

**A token is bound to the project that issued it.** The project is signed
into the JWT at login, and the gateway 401s if it does not match the key
the request arrived with. Tokens are handed to end users, and one of those
users may run a competing app — without this check, anyone holding a token
from project A could present it with their own project B key.

### Tenant isolation

Every data-plane table carries a `project_id`, every query is scoped by
it, and three things are enforced by Postgres rather than by application
code:

* **Cross-tenant transfers are impossible.** Composite `(wallet,
  project_id)` foreign keys mean a transfer whose wallets belong to
  different projects fails at COMMIT.
* **Email is unique per project**, not globally. Two customers can both
  have `alice@example.com`; they are different people.
* **Idempotency keys are scoped per project.** Two customers both using
  `order-1` is normal — and before this, the second one was handed the
  first one's transaction as a successful idempotent replay.

`GET /v1/geo/nearby` is the query that made this urgent: it searches by
position rather than by user id, so unscoped it returned every Atlas user
near a point regardless of who asked.

### Payments and the placeholder provider

`atlas.payments` runs against `FakePaymentProvider`, which approves every
charge and mints `fake_*` references. That placeholder covers the **provider
network call only**. Everything around it is real and exercised:
idempotency, the pending-then-capture ordering that keeps a crash
recoverable, the transactional outbox, the ledger updates, and webhook
signature verification.

Deposits are the only way money enters the platform — before them wallets
sat at zero and settlement refused to move funds that were not there, so no
transaction could ever complete.

Swapping in a real processor means implementing `PaymentProvider` and
setting `PAYMENT_PROVIDER`. Nothing above the interface changes. An unknown
value fails at startup rather than silently falling back to the fake, which
in production would approve charges against money never collected.

**Do not point this at real money until** a provider is implemented, the
webhook handler reconciles against `payments.transactions`, and a sweep
exists for deposits left pending by a crash between capture and credit
(migration 0033 indexes exactly those rows).

Four RPCs are deliberately unrouted: `auth.IssueToken` and
`payments.DrainOutbox` (both marked internal in their `.proto`), plus
`payments.SettleTransaction` and `payments.RefundTransaction`, which take
a bare `transaction_id` with no ownership signal the gateway could check.
Settlement is meant to be driven by the Phase 6 fare-consumer reacting to
ride lifecycle events, not by a client call.

## Event flow

Synchronous calls go through the gateway; everything asynchronous goes
through Kafka. Each topic has exactly one producer.

| Topic | Produced by | Consumed by | What the consumer does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `atlas.location.updates` | geo-engine | location-consumer | Enforces the 24h retention window on `geo.locations` |
| | | safety-consumer | Diffs geofence membership and emits crossings |
| `atlas.safety.alerts` | safety-consumer | *(developer's app)* | Geofence entry/exit, for the app to act on |
| `atlas.fare.events` | payments (outbox) | fare-consumer | Settles on `RIDE_COMPLETED`, refunds on `RIDE_CANCELLED` |
| `atlas.auth.tokens` | auth-service | auth-service | Cache invalidation fanout on revocation |
| `atlas.elo.recompute` | — | — | Not yet wired; see below |

Three things are worth knowing about this table.

**Every event carries a `project_id`.** A consumer runs long after the
request that produced the event, so there is no header and no token left
to derive a tenant from — it has to travel with the event. A consumer that
receives one without a usable project skips and commits rather than
retrying: a replay carries the same missing field, so retrying would wedge
the partition on one bad record and stall every good one behind it.

**Settlement is event-driven, not an API call.** `POST
/v1/payments/transactions` creates a pending transaction and payments
writes a `RIDE_ACCEPTED` event through its outbox. The money moves later,
when the application publishes `RIDE_COMPLETED` or `RIDE_CANCELLED` and
fare-consumer calls `SettleTransaction` / `RefundTransaction`. This is why
the gateway exposes no settle endpoint — see the note in the HTTP API
section.

**fare-consumer ignores payments' own events.** Payments publishes
`TRANSACTION_SETTLED` and `TRANSACTION_REFUNDED` onto the same topic
fare-consumer reads. Those are acknowledgements, not instructions; acting
on them would settle in response to having settled, forever. They are
recorded in the audit log and nothing else.

## Password reset and email verification

Both are two steps: ask for a token by email, then redeem it. The redeem
half needs no bearer token — whoever holds the emailed token is, for that
one call, the person the account belongs to — and no project id, because
the token names its own project and the person clicking a link has no idea
what a project is.

**The request half deliberately tells you nothing.** It answers `202
{"accepted": true}` whether or not the address belongs to a user. An
endpoint that distinguished them would be an account enumeration oracle,
and the addresses it confirmed would be exactly the ones worth attacking.

Other properties worth knowing:

* Only the SHA-256 of a token is stored, the same rule API keys follow.
  The plaintext exists in one place: the email.
* Tokens are single-use, enforced by a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE
  used_at IS NULL` rather than a read-then-write, so two clicks on one
  link cannot both succeed.
* Requesting a new link invalidates the old one, so clicking "resend"
  three times does not leave three live ways into an account in a mailbox.
* A completed reset **revokes every session** and evicts them from the
  validation cache immediately. Without that eviction a token issued
  before the reset would keep working for the rest of the 30s cache TTL —
  precisely the window the reset exists to close.
* A verification token cannot reset a password and vice versa. They are
  mailed under different pretexts, and "confirm your address" is far
  easier to get someone to click.
* Verification does **not** revoke sessions: confirming an address is not
  evidence anything leaked.

All four endpoints are on the strict credential quota — the request halves
because an unthrottled one is a way to flood somebody's inbox using your
sending reputation, the confirm halves because a token is the entire
credential.

### Atlas does not send mail

`EmailSender` is a port, exactly like `PaymentProvider` on the money side.
The only implementation is `LoggingEmailSender`, which writes the message
to the log and returns success — right for local development, catastrophic
in production, where it would print reset tokens into the log aggregator
for anyone with log access to redeem.

So the fake sender is only wired when `ATLAS_ALLOW_LOGGING_EMAIL=true` is
set — shipping it has to be somebody's decision rather than a default
nobody noticed. `docker-compose.yml` sets it; the Kubernetes manifests
deliberately do not.

With no provider configured the service still serves login and
registration, and the four email endpoints answer **422
`failed_precondition`** naming the missing configuration. Only the flows
that need mail fail. The alternative — booting a fake sender by default —
would accept reset requests and silently drop them, which a user
experiences as "the email never arrived" and an operator sees as nothing
at all.

`GET /v1/auth/me` reports `email_verified_at` — a nullable timestamp
rather than a boolean, because "when" is the question support
conversations actually ask, and a boolean cannot be widened into one later
without having already lost the answer. Gate features on it being
non-null.

That costs `/me` a second round trip, and the split is deliberate. Token
claims are fixed at issue and cached for 30 seconds; a profile *changes*
while a token is live, and verifying an address is exactly such a change.
Folding the profile into the cached claims would show a stale
"unverified" for up to half a minute to the one person guaranteed to be
looking — the user who just clicked the link. `/me` is called when an app
opens, not per location ping.

## Restore drill

A backup nobody has restored is not a backup, it is a hope. The failure
modes are unglamorous and specific — a missing PostGIS extension, an owner
that does not exist on the target, a dump taken with a flag that silently
skipped the schema — and each is discovered at the worst possible moment
unless somebody looks first.

```bash
scripts/restore-drill.sh [SOURCE_DATABASE_URL]
```

It dumps, restores into a scratch database it creates, and then *checks*
the result: row counts per table, plus the invariants that matter more
than row counts.

* **PostGIS is present and a spatial query still runs.** A restore into a
  database without the extension fails on the geometry columns; one with a
  different version can restore rows that no longer index.
* **Tenancy survived** — no user with a null `project_id`, and the
  bootstrap defaults are still dropped. A restore that quietly restored
  them would accept unscoped writes afterwards.
* **Money reconciles** — no negative balances, and no settled transfer
  whose wallets belong to different projects.
* **Index, foreign key, and migration-version counts match the source.**
  These are the objects a `--data-only` dump silently omits.

Safe to run against production: it only ever reads the source, and only
ever writes to a database it created and drops on exit — including when a
check fails, so a red drill does not leave litter that makes the next one
fail for an unrelated reason.

It runs in CI, last in the integration job — by then the test suites have
written real rows, so it dumps a database with data rather than an empty
schema. An empty one would still catch a broken dump flag, but not a
restore that loses rows.

It has been run by hand too: 17 tables, 62 indexes, 27 foreign keys,
schema version 70, all invariants green. And against a deliberately broken
backup — a `--data-only` dump, the classic silently-useless one — where it
failed as it should. A drill that has only ever passed has not been tested
either.

## Rotating the JWT signing key

A single-secret signer cannot be rotated. Changing the secret invalidates
every token signed with the old one at the instant of the change, so every
user is logged out simultaneously — during a deploy, while replicas are
already restarting, and usually in response to a suspected leak, which is
the worst possible moment to also take down authentication.

Tokens now carry a `kid` header naming the key that signed them, and
auth-service verifies against the active key plus any retired ones. That
makes rotation three independently reversible steps:

| Step | `JWT_KEY_ID` | `JWT_SECRET` | `JWT_RETIRED_KEYS` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0. before | `k1` | old | — |
| 1. deploy the new key | `k1` | old | `k2:<new>` |
| 2. promote it | `k2` | new | `k1:<old>` |
| 3. after one token lifetime | `k2` | new | — |

Only step 3 invalidates anything, and by then every token signed with the
old key has expired on its own. Each step is safe to roll back.

Two deliberate refusals: a token naming a key this deployment does not
hold is rejected on the `kid` alone rather than by trying every key, so
"signed by something we retired" and "forged" stay distinguishable and the
cost of verification does not grow with a value the caller controls. And a
malformed `JWT_RETIRED_KEYS` entry fails at startup rather than being
skipped — silently dropping a retired key logs out every user holding a
token signed with it, and the only symptom would be a support ticket.

Tokens minted before this change carry no `kid` and verify against the
active key, so deploying it logs nobody out.

## Safety scores

`POST /v1/geo/safety/votes` records one user's judgement about one place —
`safe` or `unsafe`, attributed to the token's user rather than a body
field. `GET /v1/geo/nearby` and route scoring are both computed from those
votes.

A score is the Bayesian-smoothed balance of votes near a point, bounded to
1000..2000 with 1500 meaning neutral — which is also what a place nobody
has voted on scores. One voter cannot swing a location to an extreme; two
hundred agreeing ones get most of the way. Aggregation takes each voter's
MOST RECENT verdict within 200m, so voting twice corrects rather than
stuffs the ballot, and one user is one voter however often they vote.

Every score comes with a `vote_count`, and reading them together matters:
1500 from nobody voting and 1500 from a hundred evenly split voters are
different facts, and a UI that renders them identically is claiming
knowledge it does not have.

**It is deliberately not ELO**, despite what the schema used to call it.
ELO rates competitors from pairwise outcomes — A played B, A won. Safety
votes are absolute judgements about one place with no opponent and no
match, so ELO over them produces numbers that move without meaning
anything. The old `geo.safety_ratings` table scored line segments that
nothing ever produced, alongside votes nothing ever cast; migration 0060
drops it and makes votes the single source.

Votes are per project. One customer's users voting a street unsafe does
not change what another customer's users are told about it.

`atlas.elo.recompute` remains unwired — scores are computed at read time
rather than materialised — and stays in `events.proto` as the topic a
future caching pass would use.

## Alerting

`infra/k8s/base/monitoring/alerts.yaml` holds 11 Prometheus rules. Atlas
exported a lot of metrics and, until these, alerted on none of them — a
dashboard nobody is looking at during an incident is not monitoring.

Three rules the design turns on:

* **`AtlasOutboxNotDraining`** watches the AGE of the oldest pending
  outbox row, not the count. A big backlog that is draining is a busy
  system; a small one that is not draining is a broken one, and only age
  tells them apart. It alerts on a gauge rather than on
  `outbox_dispatched_total`, because that counter simply *stops* when
  Kafka is unreachable — and a counter that stops looks exactly like a
  system with nothing to do.
* **`AtlasTenantMismatchSpike`** fires on tokens presented with the wrong
  project key. That is either a broken integration or somebody probing the
  boundary, and both deserve a human.
* **`AtlasPasswordResetsNotCompleting`** catches reset links that are
  requested but never redeemed — the signature of email failing silently,
  where nothing errors anywhere.

Every expression references a metric the services actually emit, and
`scripts/check-alert-metrics.py` enforces that in CI. An alert on a
misspelled metric never fires and never fires *silently*: Prometheus
treats a nonexistent series as empty, which is indistinguishable from
healthy, so you find out during the incident the rule was written to
catch. The YAML looks equally correct either way, which is exactly why a
reviewer cannot catch it.

Every rule carries a non-zero `for:`. All of these can spike briefly
during a deploy, and a channel that cries wolf gets muted.

## Rate limiting

The gateway and control plane both limit requests in-process. Credential
endpoints get a much smaller quota than ordinary traffic, because those are
the ones worth brute forcing:

| Service | Endpoint | Default |
|---|---|---|
| gateway | `/v1/auth/login`, `/v1/auth/register` | 10/min per client |
| gateway | everything else | 600/min per token |
| control-plane | `POST /v1/accounts` | 3/min per client |
| control-plane | everything else | 120/min per API key |

Authenticated traffic is keyed by a digest of the bearer token rather than
by IP: behind carrier-grade NAT or a corporate egress, thousands of real
users share one address, and IP keying would throttle them together while
doing nothing about one attacker rotating addresses. Health probes are
never throttled — rate limiting a liveness probe turns a busy pod into a
crash loop.

**This is per-replica.** Three gateway pods at 600/min is 1800/min
globally. A globally exact limit needs shared state on the hot path of
every request; this is the layer that stops one client exhausting one
replica, underneath the ingress limit which is the real global cap.

**`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` matters.** It defaults to `0`, meaning
`X-Forwarded-For` is ignored entirely and the socket peer address is used.
That is correct for direct exposure and safe by default: the header is
client-supplied, and trusting its first entry lets anyone mint a fresh
bucket per forged value. Behind a proxy, set it to the number of proxies
you actually run — the Kubernetes manifests set `1` for ingress-nginx.

## SDKs

Three, covering the same surface:

| | Package | Runtime dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `sdks/typescript` | none — platform `fetch` |
| Rust | `sdks/rust` | `reqwest` + `rustls`, no system TLS |
| Dart | `sdks/dart` | none — `dart:io` |

`scripts/check-sdk-coverage.py` fails CI if any of them lags the gateway.
An SDK that silently misses an endpoint looks finished, so nobody notices
until a user reaches for a raw HTTP client instead.

All three share the same decisions: the project key is required at
construction (a missing one is a configuration mistake, not a 401 on every
call), `Debug`/`toString` redacts credentials, and only idempotent
requests are retried — plus deposits and transactions, which carry an
idempotency key that is *reused across attempts*, because a fresh key per
retry would double-charge.

**The Dart SDK carries an extra warning**, because shipping it inside a
Flutter app is the obvious thing to do and would put a project key —
which can read every user and move money — into a binary anyone can
extract it from. Put it behind your own API.

`sdks/typescript` wraps the HTTP API above. No runtime dependencies — it
uses the platform `fetch`.

```ts
import { AtlasClient, AtlasError } from '@atlas/sdk';

const atlas = new AtlasClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.atlas.dev',
  projectKey: process.env.ATLAS_KEY!,   // sent on every call
});
await atlas.auth.login({ email, password });   // token stored on the client

const { users } = await atlas.geo.nearby({ lat, lng, radiusM: 500 });
const { balanceCents } = await atlas.payments.wallet();
```

Three things it inherits from the API design. No method takes a user id or
a project id — both come from credentials, mirroring the gateway's own
rules. `projectKey` is required and cannot be overridden by a caller-
supplied `headers` option, so a stray header cannot silently retarget
another project. And `payments.createTransaction` always sends an
idempotency key, which is what makes it the only POST the transport will
retry. Errors arrive as `AtlasError` carrying the stable `code` from the
envelope.

See `sdks/typescript/README.md` for the retry policy and the full surface.

## Architecture

       HTTPS        |   API Gateway   |   Rust / Axum
   ---------------->|   (port 8080)   |   JWT validation, REST to gRPC fanout
                    +-------+---------+
                            |
        +-------------------+--------------------+
        v                   v                    v

                           v
                  +-----------------+
                  |     Kafka       |
                  +-------+---------+
                          |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
        v                 v                 v
  +-----------+    +------------+    +------------+
  | location  |    |   safety   |    |    fare    |
  | consumer  |    |  consumer  |    |  consumer  |
  +-----------+    +------------+    +------------+
```

Six services, three consumers. Every service owns one database schema. Synchronous communication uses gRPC, asynchronous communication uses Kafka.
