//! Account bootstrap.
//!
//! # The chicken-and-egg problem this solves
//!
//! Every other route needs a key in the `Authorization` header, and
//! `atlas.toml` requires the developer to paste one in before `atlas
//! deploy` will even parse the file. Something has to mint the first key
//! without already holding one. That is this route.
//!
//! It is therefore the single unauthenticated write in the service, and
//! the only place a key is ever returned in plaintext.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! This is not a signup flow. There is no password, no email
//! verification, and no ownership proof — anyone who can reach the port
//! can mint an account. That is acceptable for a control plane running
//! inside a private network or on a developer's laptop, and it is not
//! acceptable on the public internet. Before this is exposed publicly it
//! needs, at minimum: verified email, a rate limit keyed on source
//! address, and an abuse story. Deploy it behind the same perimeter as
//! the rest of the control plane until then.
