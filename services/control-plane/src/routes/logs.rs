//! `atlas logs [service]`.
//!
//! # What this returns, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! This serves the control plane's own audit trail — deploys, key
//! issuance, key revocations — scoped to one project. That is real,
//! attributable data the service owns and can vouch for.
//!
//! It is *not* application log shipping. `atlas logs auth` does not return
//! stdout from auth-service, because nothing in this platform collects
//! that. Doing it properly means a log aggregator (Loki, Cloud Logging,
//! an ELK stack) scraping container stdout, with the control plane
//! querying it and enforcing per-project tenancy on the results. That is
//! an infrastructure component and a query-federation problem, not a
//! table this service can add.
//!
//! The alternative — an ingest endpoint the services POST their logs to —
//! was considered and rejected: it would mean building a log pipeline
//! nobody writes to, and shipping an empty `atlas logs` that looks broken
//! rather than one that returns less than you hoped but is honest about
//! what it is.
//!
//! The `?service=` filter still works, because audit rows carry a service
//! column. Today every row is `control-plane`; when log federation lands,
//! per-service rows join the same result set without a contract change.
