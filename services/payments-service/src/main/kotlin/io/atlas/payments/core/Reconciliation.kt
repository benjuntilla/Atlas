/**
 * Resolves transactions stuck in PENDING against the provider's own record.
 *
 * # Why a pending row is not merely untidy
 *
 * A transaction goes PENDING the moment the provider authorizes, and
 * leaves PENDING when it settles or fails. If the process dies in between
 * — a deploy, an OOM, a provider timeout after the charge went through —
 * the row stays PENDING forever. Nothing retries it, because nothing knows
 * whether retrying would be a second charge.
 *
 * That is money in limbo: the customer may have been charged and has no
 * balance to show for it, or may not have been and is owed nothing. Both
 * look identical from inside Atlas. The only source of truth is the
 * provider, which is why [PaymentProvider.lookup] exists.
 *
 * # What it refuses to do
 *
 * When the provider says UNKNOWN — unreachable, or an answer this adapter
 * does not recognise — the sweep leaves the row alone and counts it. It
 * does NOT pick a direction. Resolving on a guess is how a reconciliation
 * job turns a temporary provider outage into a pile of wrongly-settled
 * balances, and unlike the stuck row itself, that is not recoverable by
 * running the job again later.
