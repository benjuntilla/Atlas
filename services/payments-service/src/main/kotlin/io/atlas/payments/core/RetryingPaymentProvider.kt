/**
 * Adds bounded timeouts and retries around any [PaymentProvider].
 *
 * # Not everything here is retried, on purpose
 *
 * Retrying a payment operation is only safe when the provider can tell
 * that the second call is the same call. That is true of two of the four:
 *
 *  - [authorize] carries the caller's idempotency key, which is exactly
 *    what makes a replay safe — the provider returns the original result
 *    instead of charging again.
 *  - [lookup] asks a question and changes nothing.
 *
 * The other two are NOT retried:
 *
 *  - [capture] and [refund] identify the charge but carry no idempotency
 *    key of their own. Some providers treat a repeat as a no-op; others
 *    do not, and "usually idempotent" is not a property to bet customer
 *    money on. A double refund is a real loss and a hard one to notice.
 *
 * That is not a gap. A capture whose response was lost leaves the
 * transaction PENDING, and [ReconciliationSweep] resolves it by asking
 * the provider what actually happened — which is the correct way to
 * recover from an ambiguous write, rather than repeating it and hoping.
 *
 * # Timeouts
 *
 * Every call is bounded, because the failure mode of an unbounded
 * provider call is worse than an error: the request thread parks, the
 * connection pool drains behind it, and a slow processor becomes an
 * outage in a service that is otherwise healthy.
