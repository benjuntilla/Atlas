//! Tenant resolution: which project does this request belong to?
//!
//! # Two credentials, two questions
//!
//! Atlas requests carry two independent identities and it is important not
//! to conflate them:
//!
//!   * `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` — WHO the end user is. Issued by
//!     auth-service to a person using the developer's app. Handled by
//!     [`crate::extract::AuthUser`].
//!   * `X-Atlas-Key: atl_live_…` — WHICH CUSTOMER'S APPLICATION is asking.
//!     Issued by the control plane to a developer, and held server-side by
//!     their backend. Handled here.
//!
//! A user token says nothing about the project, and a project key says
//! nothing about the user. Both are required on every `/v1` route, which
//! is why this is a layer rather than a per-handler extractor: a new route
//! added to any of the `/v1` sub-routers is covered without anyone
//! remembering to cover it. Forgetting a tenant check is not the kind of
//! mistake that shows up in testing — it shows up as one customer reading
//! another's data.
//!
//! # Why this reads Postgres directly
//!
//! The obvious alternative is a `ResolveKey` RPC on the control plane. It
//! was rejected because it would put the control-plane PROCESS on the
//! critical path of every data-plane request: a control-plane deploy or
//! crash would take the whole API down with it. Postgres is already a hard
//! dependency of every backend, so reading `control.api_keys` here adds no
//! availability edge that does not already exist. The cost is that the
//! gateway knows one table in the control schema, which is a narrower and
//! more visible coupling than a new runtime dependency.
//!
//! The query is read-only and touches a single unique index.
//!
//! # Caching
//!
//! Results are cached in-process for a short TTL, mirroring the 30s
//! auth-service keeps for token validation. Negative results are cached
//! too, and that is not an optimisation: without it, a flood of invalid
//! keys becomes a flood of Postgres queries, and the cheapest possible
//! request for an attacker to send would be the most expensive one for us
//! to answer.
//!
//! The TTL is the revocation window. `atlas keys revoke` takes effect
//! within `PROJECT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` rather than instantly, which is the
//! same bargain the token cache already makes.
