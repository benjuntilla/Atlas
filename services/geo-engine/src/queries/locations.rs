///
/// Most queries in Atlas reach a row through a user id, and user ids are
/// UUIDs — so even unscoped, they could not accidentally return another
/// tenant's data. This one is different: it searches by POSITION. Without
/// `l.project_id = $6` it returns every Atlas user near that point no
/// matter whose application asked, which is a cross-tenant read of people's
/// locations. It was exactly that until this filter existed.
///
/// The safety_ratings join is scoped for the same reason: the scores are
/// derived from one tenant's users' votes, and letting another tenant's
/// votes move the number would leak behaviour across the boundary.
///
/// # Why every spatial predicate casts to `::geography`
///
/// `geo.locations.position` is `GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)`. On a *geometry*,
/// `ST_DWithin` and `ST_Distance` work in the SRID's own units, and 4326's
/// unit is the **degree** — so `ST_DWithin(a, b, 250)` asks "within 250
/// degrees", roughly 27,000 km, and matches every row on Earth. Casting
/// both operands to `geography` switches PostGIS to spheroidal maths in
/// **meters**, which is what the `_m` suffix has always claimed.
