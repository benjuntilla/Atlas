//! `atlas-migrate` — applies the SQL in `migrations/` and records what ran.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Until now `migrations/` was mounted into the Postgres container at
//! `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. That directory runs **only on a
//! database's first boot**. Every consequence of that was bad:
//!
//!   * A new migration file was silently ignored by anyone who already had
//!     a volume — including every developer on the team and every deployed
//!     environment. The schema you got depended on when you first ran
//!     `docker compose up`.
//!   * Nothing recorded which migrations had been applied, so there was no
//!     way to ask a database what state it was in.
//!   * There was no path at all to apply a schema change to a running
//!     production database. That alone makes the old arrangement
//!     unshippable.
//!
//! This binary replaces it. It tracks applied versions in `_sqlx_migrations`,
//! applies only what is pending, wraps each migration in a transaction, and
//! verifies checksums so an already-applied file cannot be edited out from
//! under a deployed environment.
//!
//! # Deployment shape
//!
//! Migrations run as a separate step that completes before any service
//! starts — a Kubernetes `Job` with the app Deployments waiting on it, and
//! a one-shot container in docker-compose. Services never migrate on
//! startup: with several replicas booting at once that is a race, and a
//! failed migration would take down every pod instead of one Job.
//!
//! The SQL is embedded at compile time, so the runtime image carries no
//! files and cannot drift from the binary.
//!
//! # Adopting this on an existing database
//!
//! A database already provisioned by the old initdb path has the schema
//! but no `_sqlx_migrations` table, so a plain `run` would try to re-apply
//! everything and fail on the first `CREATE TABLE` (the failure is clean —
//! the transaction rolls back — but the database stays unusable by this
//! tool).
//!
//! `baseline --through <version>` marks migrations up to that version as
//! applied without executing them, and leaves everything above it pending
//! for a subsequent `run`. The version is required rather than defaulted:
//! this tool cannot verify which migrations a legacy database actually
//! received, and guessing would silently skip real schema changes. Only an
//! operator who has looked at the schema knows. It is the one command here
//! that can write history that never happened, so it also refuses unless
//! the database looks provisioned at all.
