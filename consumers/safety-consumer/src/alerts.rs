/// * Commit first, then publish — a crash in between loses the alert
///   permanently. The replayed ping diffs against the already-updated

///   alert, because the replayed ping still sees the old membership.
///
/// For a safety signal a duplicate "left the safe zone" is an annoyance
/// and a missed one is a failure, so this publishes first and commits
/// after. A publish error propagates, the transaction rolls back, the
/// Kafka offset is not committed, and the whole thing replays.
///
/// The cost is a broker round trip inside a database transaction, which
/// payments-service deliberately avoids for provider calls. It is
/// acceptable here where it is not there: the lock covers one user's
/// membership rows rather than a wallet, and the publish is a
/// sub-millisecond local-network ack with a hard 10s timeout, not a
/// third-party HTTP call.

/// partition during a rebalance cannot interleave into a half-applied
