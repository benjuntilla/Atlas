/**
 * Decides what each fare event means and carries it out.
 *
 * # The reaction table
 *
 * | Event                | Action                          |
 * |----------------------|---------------------------------|
 * | RIDE_ACCEPTED        | audit only                      |
 * | RIDE_COMPLETED       | SettleTransaction               |
 * | RIDE_CANCELLED       | RefundTransaction               |
 * | TRANSACTION_SETTLED  | audit only                      |
 * | TRANSACTION_REFUNDED | audit only                      |
 *
 * The two TRANSACTION_* rows are the important ones. Payments publishes
 * those itself from inside `settle` and `refund`, onto the same topic
 * this consumer reads. Treating them as instructions would mean settling
 * in response to having settled — an infinite loop through Kafka. They
 * are acknowledgements, so they are only ever recorded.
 *
 * RIDE_ACCEPTED is likewise payments' own announcement that it created a
 * transaction; the transaction already exists by then.
 *
 * # Ordering: act first, then audit
 *
 * A replayed event must not skip its action. If the audit row were
 * written first, a crash in between would leave a log entry claiming the
 * event was handled while the settlement never happened, and the replay
 * would dedup itself into doing nothing. Acting first is safe in the
 * other direction because the money operations are idempotent upstream:
 * settling an already-settled transaction returns success without moving
 * anything.
