//! The Atlas API key format: minting, display prefixes, and digests.
//!
//! This lives in its own crate because two services must agree on it
//! exactly: the control plane MINTS keys, and the gateway RESOLVES them on
//! every data-plane request to decide which project a caller belongs to.
//! A second copy of `hash` or `looks_like_key` that drifted by one
//! character would not fail loudly — it would quietly reject every valid
//! key, or worse, accept a shape the issuer never mints.
//!
//! # Format
//!
//! `atl_{tier}_{32 hex chars}` — e.g. `atl_live_9f3c1e...`. The tier comes
//! from the project's environment, and the three schemes are exactly the
//! ones `cli/src/config.rs` accepts in `KEY_PREFIXES`; a key this module
//! mints must pass `atlas validate` when pasted into `atlas.toml`, which
//! also means it must be at least 24 characters.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Only the SHA-256 digest is persisted. The plaintext is returned once,
//! at creation, and cannot be recovered afterwards.
//!
//! SHA-256 rather than bcrypt/Argon2 is deliberate and is the opposite of
//! the choice auth-service makes for passwords. A password is low-entropy
//! and guessable, so it needs a deliberately slow KDF. An API key here is
//! 128 bits of CSPRNG output — there is no dictionary to run against it,
//! and brute force is not a threat model a slow hash improves. What a slow
//! KDF *would* do is add its cost to every authenticated request, since
//! the key is presented on each one.
